TinaCMS Version `1.1.3` (and `@tinacms/cli@1.0.6`) brings some improvements for various frameworks, and list-field improvements.

## Testing

The user can now model a shortcode like so:

```
    name: "rimg",
    label: "rimg",
    match: {
      start: "{{<",
      end: ">}}",
    },
    fields: [
      {
        name: "myprop",
        label: "my prop",
        type: "string",
      },
    ],
```

outputs `<<% rimg myprop="" %>>`

Previously, this would match any content within `{{<` and `>}}`. Now, this will only match when the name of the shortcode also matches.

Editors will also be able to edit fields in the shortcodes indivudually, instead of through a global `text` field.



See [here](https://tina.io/docs/reference/types/rich-text/#custom-shortcode-syntax) for more info.

## Min/Max Support in list fields

The field UI object now accepts a `min` and `max` when the field is `list: true`. If the list/group list/block field is at the max or min value, the add or remove buttons are disabled.



## TOML & YML Support

### Customizable Frontmatter Format Updates

Collections can now specify `{ frontmatterFormat: 'toml' | 'yaml' | 'json' }` and `{frontmatterDelimiters: string | [string, string] }`.

This allows the user to have more control of how their frontmatter is parsed.

### `yaml` and `toml` Document Formats

In a collection `format` can now be `yaml` or `toml`.

## Other Improvements & Fixes
